# Personal project management system

This is a github page for management system I created for myself years ago before I started using git.
It had a lot of nifty features and was tailored to what I needed.

I always loved an idea for quick copy/paste, instal, readme, and run functionality (git doesn't have it...).
The structure was supposed to be super simple and give a lot of options.

The core idea was to segregate everything into projects.
Each project is a folder with scripts and version folders.

There can be a general readme (notice I didn't know about markdown back there), installation, run, edit, and load scripts for a project.
Everything could be configured for every version or a whole project using bash scripts.
It allowed for setting up environment variables and configuring the whole system for specific workflow on a per project version basis.

If everything was set up properly, once somebody wanted to use something, it was enough to copy/paste the directory into ~/Projects/ directory and call install.

None the less, when I found git, I stopped using it.
